            <p>A flying taxi (also known as a drone taxi, passenger drone, or pilotless helicopter) is a type of personal air vehicle (PAV). it is an emerging type of air transportation service proposed to provide on demand air travel services. much like taxis. The emergence of this alternative to traditional ground transport methods has been enabled by unmanned aerial vehicle technologies and electric propulsion. The first passenger drone was introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2016 by Chinese entrepreneurs and is called the Ehang 184.</p>

            <P>Overcrowded roads, mile-long traffic jams and collapsing local transport systems in metropolitan areas require innovative solutions. Both established aviation companies and start-ups from all over the world are therefore researching aircraft that will shift local transport from the road to the air. Electrically powered "air taxis" could solve two problems at once: by dispensing with fossil fuels, particulate matter and CO² emissions can be reduced considerably, and by shifting local transport into the air, roads are relieved.The new propulsion technologies should also help to manage the conflict of interests between climate protection and increasing capacity requirements. Low prices and an ever-expanding route network make this possible: 9 billion passengers are expected to fly by 2050. This means that the passenger volume will more than double compared to the current level. This development will also be favoured by the production stop of the Airbus A380 and the change of course from wide-body aircraft to medium-haul jets. This will inevitably lead to growing aircraft fleets and even more traffic in the sky. some morre of their advantages are :</P>

The company has spent the last 10 years developing its own electric motors and technology for its eVTOL aircraft.In February 2018, the company announced that it received $100 million in venture funding from investors such as Capricorn Investment Group, Intel Capital, JetBlue Technology Ventures and Toyota AI Ventures.</p><br><br><br><br><hr>

The Mountain View, California-based startup has developed three all-electric flying vehicles; however, only two prototypes seem poised to fly in the urban air taxi market (Kitty Hawk’s Flyer is a single-seat hovercraft intended for recreational use).</p><br><br><br><br><hr>

The Munich-based air taxi startup completed the first vertical flight test of its new eVTOL five-seater aircraft, the Lilium Jet, in May. Lilium’s CEO and founder, Daniel Wiegand, said that within five years, a fleet of Lilium Jets may be shuttling people from Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport in 10 minutes for $70 a seat. </p><br><br><br><br><hr>

The startup was created by Massachusetts Institute of Technology grads in 2006, and it was acquired in 2017 by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, the same Chinese company that owns Volvo Cars and Lotus. </p><br><br><br><br><hr>

Considering that unlike other wannabe first-to-market UAM pioneers, Uber already has an app and brand that consumers recognize, the company is in a good position to break away from the pack. Uber is working with six aircraft manufacturers, each of which is developing an eVTOL aircraft designed and built for aerial ridesharing. The companies are Bell, Boeing Company, EmbraerX, Jaunt Air Mobility, Karem Aircraft and Pipistrel. </p><br><br><br><br><hr>

The 2X can carry two people at speeds up to about 68 mph, and it has a flight time of 30 minutes with a maximum range of 17 miles. It can either be piloted or fly autonomously, and the 2X’s batteries can be easily swapped out by robots before continuing each trip.  </p><br><br><br><br><hr>

            <p>The future of passenger drones remains uncertain since this technology is so new. Innovation in aerial drone technology, and in aerial traffic coordination, control, and collision-avoidance could result in rapid proliferation of passenger drones for civilian travel. Several companies are exploring the use of passenger drones as air-taxis and for air-ambulance services.[7] Passenger drone developers are working to overcome many challenges, including noise, small useful load, short flight times, airspace regulations, and scarce data on both safety and general operations.</p>
