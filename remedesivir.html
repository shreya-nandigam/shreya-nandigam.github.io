        What Is Remdesivir, the First Drug That Treats Coronavirus?

        Remdesivir doesn’t cure coronavirus. But the experimental drug, which may speed up recovery 
        from a COVID-19 infection, is currently the best treatment we have against a virus that’s on a global rampage. 
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: .5cm;">
        Late last week, the FDA authorized emergency use of the antiviral drug. 
        The move came on the heels of preliminary results from a clinical trial that found patients treated 
        with remdesivir had a 31 percent faster recovery than those who received a placebo. Average recovery 
        was shortened to 11 days from 15 days, and the drug also slightly decreased the likelihood of dying from COVID-19.

        “Although a 31 percent improvement doesn’t seem like a knockout 100 percent, it is a very important proof of concept 
        because what it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” Anthony Fauci told reporters at a White House meeting 
        announcing the findings. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also likened 
        the finding to discovering the first modestly effective antiviral treatment for HIV decades ago.

    <p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: .5cm;">
        But there are many questions around remdesivir’s ability to stand up to COVID-19. Chief among them is that a randomized 
        and controlled study — released by The Lancet the same day — found conflicting results about the drug’s effectiveness. 
        The study, which took place in China, found that remdesivir did not quicken recovery or reduce deaths from COVID-19 compared
         with a placebo.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: .5cm;">
        Factors that might explain the different conclusions is that the participants in the Chinese study may have been more severely
         ill by the time they received remdesivir, and that the study ended earlier than planned because a decline in coronavirus cases
          in China impacted participant enrollment. But not everyone agrees that these were significant factors affecting the outcome.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;font-size: .5cm;">
        In any case, remdesivir is far from being a miracle drug, and it seems unlikely that it will make coronavirus a milder, more 
        manageable disease anytime soon.
