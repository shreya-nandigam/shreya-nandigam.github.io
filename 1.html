                The Earth's average temperature is about 15 degree celsius but has been much higher and lower in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature.
            </p>
            <p> 
                This is known as climate change or global warming.
