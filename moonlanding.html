             <p style="font-size: .5cm;"><b>NASA’s bid to return humans to the surface of the moon in 2024  is far from a sure thing. The Artemis program, started at the behest of the Trump administration, is being dogged by delays, cash shortfalls, and the absence of a real step-by-step plan. There is a strong possibility the mission will be delayed to 2025 or later, or that congressional leadership will force NASA to change its human exploration agenda yet again.</b></p>

             <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">But NASA isn't the only one planning a moon trip. Many other countries and private companies are eager to get in on the excitement. For some, space exploration is still a powerful amplifier for prestige and glory. For many others, however, the moon rush really is a scramble to prospect for valuable lunar resources before others can. Water ice reserves could be harvested into propellant that makes travel through deep space vastly less expensive. Helium-3, extremely rare on Earth, could help power future spacecraft. Rare or precious metals important to helping us run new technologies could be more easily accessible on the moon than anywhere on Earth.</p>
             <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Over the next few years, we’ll see the launch of more than a dozen different lunar missions. Some will just orbit or loop around the moon, some will land, some will deploy rovers and other robots for deeper exploration. Many are tasked with prospecting for water ice and other resources. And all of these missions are just a prelude for a permanent human presence on the moon, and establishing a pit stop for traveling to Mars.</p>
             <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Artemis 1 is basically a test on two fronts: it’s the inaugural launch of NASA’s Space Launch System (which will be the heaviest rocket in the world and literally move the agency’s deep space exploration missions forward) and the first real deep-space test of the Orion crew capsule, which will spend six days in lunar orbit. Though it will be crewless, a number of low-cost experiments are going up on Artemis 1. Many will study the lunar environment, such as measuring radiation levels or how dust behaves during landing sequences. The most exciting, however, will attempt to pinpoint locations of exposed water ice on the surface.</p>
             <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">China’s remarkably successful Chang’e lunar exploration program shows no signs of slowing down. If successful, Chang’e 5 will be China’s third successful spacecraft landing on the moon. Though not a rover like the previous two Chang’e iterations, this will be the country’s first sample-return mission, bringing back at least two kilograms of lunar material from two meters below the surface. Chang’e 6 is really just a redux of this same sample-return mission, although it will most probably include additional scientific payloads to study the lunar soil and atmosphere.</p>
