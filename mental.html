            Psychiatrists have a dizzying array of diagnoses and not enough treatments.<br>
             Hunting for the hidden biology underlying mental disorders could help.

        <p style="color: whitesmoke;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
            In 2018, psychiatrist Oleguer Plana-Ripoll was wrestling with a puzzling fact about mental disorders. 
            He knew that many individuals have multiple conditions — anxiety and depression, say, or schizophrenia
             and bipolar disorder. He wanted to know how common it was to have more than one diagnosis, so he got 
             his hands on a database containing the medical details of around 5.9 million Danish citizens.
        </p>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
            He was taken aback by what he found. Every single mental disorder predisposed the patient to every other 
            mental disorder — no matter how distinct the symptoms1. “We knew that comorbidity was important, but we 
            didn’t expect to find associations for all pairs,” says Plana-Ripoll, who is based at Aarhus University
             in Denmark.
        </p>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
            The study tackles a fundamental question that has bothered researchers for more than a century.
             What are the roots of mental illness?
        </p>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
            In the hope of finding an answer, scientists have piled up an enormous amount of data over the past decade, 
            through studies of genes, brain activity and neuroanatomy. They have found evidence that many of the same
             genes underlie seemingly distinct disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, and that changes in the 
             brain’s decision-making systems could be involved in many conditions.
        </p>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
            Researchers are also drastically rethinking theories of how our brains go wrong. The idea that mental 
            illness can be classified into distinct, discrete categories such as ‘anxiety’ or ‘psychosis’ has been
             disproved to a large extent. Instead, disorders shade into each other, and there are no hard dividing 
             lines — as Plana-Ripoll’s study so clearly demonstrated.
        </p>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
            Now, researchers are trying to understand the biology that underlies this spectrum of psychopathology.
        </p>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
            They have a few theories. Perhaps there are several dimensions of mental illness — so, depending on how
             a person scores on each dimension, they might be more prone to some disorders than to others. An alternative, 
             more radical idea is that there is a single factor that makes people prone to mental illness in general: 
             which disorder they develop is then determined by other factors. Both ideas are being taken seriously, 
             although the concept of multiple dimensions is more widely accepted by researchers.
        </p>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
            The details are still fuzzy, but most psychiatrists agree that one thing is clear: the old system of categorizing
             mental disorders into neat boxes does not work. They are also hopeful that, in the long run, replacing this
              framework with one that is grounded in biology will lead to new drugs and treatments. Researchers aim to reveal,
               for instance, the key genes, brain regions and neurological processes involved in psychopathology, and target 
               them with therapies. Although it might take a while to get there, says Steven Hyman of the Broad Institute of 
               MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, “I am long-term optimistic if the field really does its work.”
