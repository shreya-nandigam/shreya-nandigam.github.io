            <p><b>NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine announced plans to launch a SpaceX</b></p></center>
        <center><p style="font-family:cursive;color: white;">Falcon 9 rocket carrying two astronauts to the International Space Station 
                (ISS) on May 27. If the launch takes place, it will be the first time an
                 American rocket will carry passengers to orbit since the final space shuttle
                 launch on July 8, 2011.</p>
            <p style="font-family: cursive;color: white;">The covid-19 pandemic looms over the mission, which is scheduled to launch from the Kennedy Space
                     Center in Florida. The state is under a stay-at-home order currently due to expire on April 30, with 
                     exemptions for essential activities. The federal government has broad latitude to declare activities
                      essential. However, critics argue that this mission is anything but.
                    </p>
            <p style="font-family: cursive;color: white;">NASA is taking measures to mitigate the impact of the launch: spectators will not be allowed to watch 
                from normal viewing sites along Florida’s “space coast,” and only a limited number of reporters will be
                allowed on site. However, a launch like this involves about 350 NASA employees, according to an
                 interview Bridenstine gave to CNBC, along with several hundred SpaceX employees. Bridenstine told 
                 CNBC that NASA workers will be working in shifts designed to increase social distancing over normal
                  practices, and wearing personal protective equipment when necessary.</p>
            <p style="font-family: cursive;color: white;">In March 2019, a Crew Dragon spacecraft autonomously docked with the space station on an uncrewed
                 test flight. A second Crew Dragon was destroyed in a fire during an engine test in April of last year, 
                 causing a delay in the launch that was announced today.</p>
            <p style="font-family: cursive;color: white;">A rival Boeing effort, called Starliner, which NASA is also funding for the sake of competition, has been 
                even more troubled. Its first uncrewed test flight, in December 2019, ended in failure after the vehicle
                 was unable to rendezvous with the ISS because of a software error. Even worse errors were discovered
                  when the first error was being investigated. Boeing is planning, but has not yet scheduled, a second
                   uncrewed test flight and hopes to send a crewed Starliner mission to the ISS by 2021.</p>
            <p style="font-family: cursive;color: white;">The May 27 mission was originally meant to be a short-duration stay at the ISS of one to two weeks, but
                 NASA has left open the possibility the flight test will be converted into a longer mission. </p>    
            <p style="font-family: cursive;color: white;">According to NASA, the Crew Dragon being used for this flight will be capable of staying in orbit for
                 about 110 days. Whenever the mission ends, the vehicle will depart the space station carrying the two 
                 astronauts who launched on it back to Earth.</p></center>
